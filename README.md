# Lab 04: Grid or Flex

## Feature #1: Responsive design
- Why
    - As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.
- What
    - Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device
- When
    - Then the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors
- How
    - Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
    - Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
    - Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
